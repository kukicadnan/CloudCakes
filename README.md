# Migrate Parse Users to Auth0

This is a sample app demonstrating how to migrate your existing Parse users to Auth0. For additional details see the following [post](htps://auth0.com/blog).

## Prerequisite - Auth0 Account

You will need an Auth0 account for this example to work. Head over to [Auth0](https://auth0.com) and create one if you haven't already.

1. Login into your Auth0 Dashboard
2. Get your Client Id and Domain
3. Open the auth0-variables-example.js file and insert your Client Id and Domain
4. Rename the auth0-variables-example.js to auth0-variables.js

## Running the example

In order to run the example you need to just start a server. What we suggest is doing the following:

1. Install node
2. run npm install
3. run node server

Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you'll see the app running :).
